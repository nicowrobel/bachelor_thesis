  abstract     = {A new scheme for accelerating electrons, employing a bunched relativistic electron beam in a cold plasma, is analyzed. We show that energy gradients can exceed 1 GeV/m and that the driven electrons can be accelerated from γ0mc2 to 3γ0mc2 before the driving beam slows down enough to degrade the plasma wave. If the driving electrons are removed before they cause the collapse of the plasma wave, energies up to 4γc0mc2 are possible. A noncollinear injection scheme is suggested in order that the driving electrons can be removed.},

  abstract     = {We report on experimental investigations of plasma wave structures in a plasma wakefield
acceleration (PWFA) stage which is driven by electron beams from a preceding laser plasma
accelerator. Femtosecond optical probing is utilized to allow for direct visualization of the plasma
dynamics inside the target. We compare two regimes in which the driver propagates either through
an initially neutral gas, or a preformed plasma. In the first case, plasma waves are observed that
quickly damp after a few oscillations and are located within a narrow plasma channel ionized by
the driver, having about the same transverse size as the plasma wakefield cavities. In contrast, for
the latter robust cavities are recorded sustained over many periods. Furthermore, here an
elongation of the first cavity is measured, which becomes stronger with increasing driver beam
charge. Since the cavity length is linked to the maximum accelerating field strength, this elongation
implies an increased field strength. This observation is supported by 3D particle-in-cell
simulations performed with PIConGPU. This work can be extended for the investigation of driver
depletion by probing at different propagation distances inside the plasma, which is essential for the
development of high energy efficiency PWFAs.},

  abstract     = {Plasma wakefield accelerators are capable of sustaining gigavolt-per-centimeter accelerating fields, surpassing the electric breakdown threshold in state-of-the-art accelerator modules by 3-4 orders of magnitude. Beam-driven wakefields offer particularly attractive conditions for the generation and acceleration of high-quality beams. However, this scheme relies on kilometer-scale accelerators. Here, we report on the demonstration of a millimeter-scale plasma accelerator powered by laser-accelerated electron beams. We showcase the acceleration of electron beams to 128 MeV, consistent with simulations exhibiting accelerating gradients exceeding 100 GV m−1. This miniaturized accelerator is further explored by employing a controlled pair of drive and witness electron bunches, where a fraction of the driver energy is transferred to the accelerated witness through the plasma. Such a hybrid approach allows fundamental studies of beam-driven plasma accelerator concepts at widely accessible high-power laser facilities. It is anticipated to provide compact sources of energetic high-brightness electron beams for quality-demanding applications such as free-electron lasers.},

With the advent of graphical processing units (GPUs), large-scale plasma simulations on inexpensive GPU clusters are in reach. We present an implementation of a fully relativistic plasma PIC algorithm for GPUs based on the NVIDIA CUDA library. It supports a hybrid architecture consisting of single computation nodes interconnected in a standard cluster topology, with each node carrying one or more GPUs. The internode communication is realized using the message-passing interface. The simulation code PIConGPU presented in this paper is, to our knowledge, the first scalable GPU cluster implementation of the PIC algorithm in plasma physics.},
