  abstract  = {A new scheme for accelerating electrons, employing a bunched relativistic electron beam in a cold plasma, is analyzed. We show that energy gradients can exceed 1 GeV/m and that the driven electrons can be accelerated from γ0mc2 to 3γ0mc2 before the driving beam slows down enough to degrade the plasma wave. If the driving electrons are removed before they cause the collapse of the plasma wave, energies up to 4γc0mc2 are possible. A noncollinear injection scheme is suggested in order that the driving electrons can be removed.},

  abstract  = {We report on experimental investigations of plasma wave structures in a plasma wakefield
acceleration (PWFA) stage which is driven by electron beams from a preceding laser plasma
accelerator. Femtosecond optical probing is utilized to allow for direct visualization of the plasma
dynamics inside the target. We compare two regimes in which the driver propagates either through
an initially neutral gas, or a preformed plasma. In the first case, plasma waves are observed that
quickly damp after a few oscillations and are located within a narrow plasma channel ionized by
the driver, having about the same transverse size as the plasma wakefield cavities. In contrast, for
the latter robust cavities are recorded sustained over many periods. Furthermore, here an
elongation of the first cavity is measured, which becomes stronger with increasing driver beam
charge. Since the cavity length is linked to the maximum accelerating field strength, this elongation
implies an increased field strength. This observation is supported by 3D particle-in-cell
simulations performed with PIConGPU. This work can be extended for the investigation of driver
depletion by probing at different propagation distances inside the plasma, which is essential for the
development of high energy efficiency PWFAs.},
