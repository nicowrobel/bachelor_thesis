1. Introduction
2. Theoretical Background
	2.1 LWFA (short)
	2.2 PWFA
	(Plamsa, L/PWFA Hybrid, relativistic Particles?)
	2.3 PiC + PIConGPU (with acceleration phase)
3. Setup of the Simulation
	3.1 Parameters
	3.2 Setting up the bunch from script
	3.3 Entering Plasma
4. Investigating Peak energy
	4.1 It stays constant
	(losing energy at plasma start, multiple smaller peaks)
	4.2 Connection to start energy


vaccum propagation
(Something about stability)
